CodeCademy Final Project (Web Design)

Goals: 1.) Create page from scratch following redline (https://content.codecademy.com/programs/freelance-one/excursion/mocks/excursion_redline.png)
       2.) Create Github repository for project, and use multiple pushes to track source control (project calls for command line / BASH, utilising GitHub Desktop instead)
